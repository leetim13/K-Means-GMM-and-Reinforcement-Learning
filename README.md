# K-Means, GMM, and Reinforcement Learning

- Reinforcement Learning: Implemented Qlearning algorithms withboth epsilon-greedy and softmax policy in a
stochastic maze environment.

- Unsupervised Learning: Experimented and evaluated both k-Means and EM algorithm with Gaussian mixtures on different data cluster assignments
